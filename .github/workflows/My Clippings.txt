It is only when one faces oneself in solitude and accepts the reality of one’s differentiated nature and uniqueness that one begins to see in others the same expression of uniqueness and individuality.

Earlier we discussed the concept of the wise-line (Chapter III). We saw that it aspires to represent the best possible cross section of the totality of a country and that its aim is to capture the soul of that country. We also saw that its construction was determined by four elements: the magnification of exploration, isolating the common characteristics of the country, honoring one’s loves and interests, and allowing openness to surprise to modify it into something that is alive, constantly adapting and changing. We may now use these concepts from the travel-journey to shed light upon our life’s-journey.

The only way to learn to fly is to spread and flap your wings in the air; the only way to learn to explore new places is to leave your home and start exploring; the only way to begin a new life is to begin it. And no, these statements are not tautological! Moving into any Unknown is an act. And this act is different from the endless “thinking about it,” “planning it,” “preparing for it” – the equivalent of the useless activity of a hapless eagle daydreaming about his imminent first flight.

An attacker, particularly a state, could attempt to attack Bitcoin through taking control of existing mining infrastructure and using it unprofitably in order to undermine the safety of the network. The fact that Bitcoin mining is widely distributed geographically makes this a challenging prospect that would require collaboration from various governments worldwide. A better way to implement this might be not through physically taking over mining equipment but commandeering it through hardware backdoors.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves. This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it’s not necessarily the best way to live.

Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support. The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.

People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy.

The victim, if he really loved the saver, would say, “Look, this is my problem; you don’t have to fix it for me. Just support me while I fix it myself.” That would actually be a demonstration of love: taking responsibility for your own problems and not holding your partner responsible for them. If the saver really wanted to save the victim, the saver would say, “Look, you’re blaming others for your own problems; deal with this yourself.” And in a sick way, that would actually be a demonstration of love: helping someone solve their own problems.

For victims, the hardest thing to do in the world is to hold themselves accountable for their problems. They’ve spent their whole life believing that others are responsible for their fate. That first step of taking responsibility for themselves is often terrifying. For savers, the hardest thing to do in the world is to stop taking responsibility for other people’s problems. They’ve spent their whole life feeling valued and loved only when they’re saving somebody else—so letting go of this need is terrifying to them as well.

People with strong boundaries understand that it’s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has. People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone’s feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can’t determine how other people feel. People with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another’s emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems. It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby.

Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy?

And entitlement strips this away from us. The gravity of entitlement sucks all attention inward, toward ourselves, causing us to feel as though we are at the center of all of the problems in the universe, that we are the one suffering all of the injustices, that we are the one who deserves greatness over all others. As alluring as it is, entitlement isolates us.

It’s these dynamics that plague us now. We are so materially well off, yet so psychologically tormented in so many low-level and shallow ways. People relinquish all responsibility, demanding that society cater to their feelings and sensibilities. People hold on to arbitrary certainties and try to enforce them on others, often violently, in the name of some made-up righteous cause. People, high on a sense of false superiority, fall into inaction and lethargy for fear of trying something worthwhile and failing at it.

You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to. This mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already makes you loved. Even if you don’t realize it. Even if you’re sleeping in a gutter and starving.

This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death. The more I peer into the darkness, the brighter life gets, the quieter the world becomes, and the less unconscious resistance I feel to, well, anything.

It showed them how to appear high status even if they weren’t high status. Except it forgot one thing: women aren’t stupid.

Women are generally only attracted to men who are less invested in them, than they are in themselves. By investment I mean the degree in which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts/feelings/motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should only be willing to sacrifice your thoughts/ feelings/motivations for a woman less than she is willing to do the same for you.

Guy meets girl. Guy shows less investment than girl (or induces more investment in girl), sex and/or relationship occurs, guy becomes more invested than girl, sex stops and/or relationship falls apart. The first story is an example of why it’s important to lower one’s neediness by investing in himself rather than the woman he’s with. It’s the only long-term solution available to keep long-term relationships stable and happy.

To make money you need to have money. In other words, to maximise profits you have to minimise losses. You must preserve your capital. When you are losing you have to materially adapt to mitigate the situation, as you will see when we come to the Assassins and the Hunters. Permanent impairment of capital destroys wealth.

I am done with compromises with others. I will be free of expectations and constraints. I will be free of everything except for the most essential of possessions. I think that it was Tyler Durden who said, “It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.” I will live on my own terms and forge my own path in the universe.

On the other hand, allow me a moment to be unfashionable and state that I think that cocaine is crap. If you don't believe me and are caught up in the whole romance surrounding blow, I dare you to hang out sober (or even just drinking) in a small room of people doing lines.

I've snorted it, smoked it, drank it, you name it—everything short of shooting it—and it took me a while to come to terms with the fact I never really enjoyed it that much. The whole cult of cocaine, with all of these bankers, hipsters, and brokers thinking that they're the man with their heavily cut eight balls, is a bunch of misguided hype. Foreign exoticism and our national obsession with performance enhancers have raised the stock of the substance from a cheap plant derivative to a social phenomenon. It's similar to when an Eastern European high roller takes his elegant date to T.G.I. Friday's in Moscow and thinks that he's the shit. And he may be the shit in that time and place. But when he then experiences T.G.I. Friday's at O'Hare, or a coke aficionado gets down to Peru and sees the drug without all of the mystique, it is clear that they've been duped. T.G.I. Friday's is a sit-down McDonald's and the magic powder is a bunch of smashed bush leaves run through chemicals that you could find on the shelves of your grandfather's garage. If rum inspired characters as extraordinary and enduring as Black Beard, Captain Kidd, and George Washington, who has coke inspired? Andy Gibb, Corey Haim, and Roger Clinton? “Take your medicine like a good boy.” The Doctor holds out a key; the tip is piled high with the pinkish white flakes. My eyes dart about quickly and I lean in to take the bump. So much for soliloquies. “Who says I don't care about your well-being?” he asks. “Who says that I care about my own well-being?” I retort. I have penciled out a list of pros and cons regarding the Lonely Planet offer and begin to read it aloud. I can tell that the Doctor isn't listening. He's still wasted from the night before and has had an argument with his girlfriend, Sandra. The quarrel degenerated to the point that she punched him in the face, three times. The Doc and I are swirling around the drain in a similar mental state and that's always dangerous, as neither of us is the type of person to say, “No, thank you, let's call it a night.” I continue with my list, my voice trailing off. I am reading in my head as much as out loud. Pro: I will cover the Brazilian states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Piauí, and Maranhão. Con: I will then have to write nearly a hundred pages and update a dozen maps. Pro: It is recommended that I travel in Brazil for four weeks. Con: There is no way that I can do that much research in four weeks.

On the other hand, allow me a moment to be unfashionable and state that I think that cocaine is crap. If you don't believe me and are caught up in the whole romance surrounding blow, I dare you to hang out sober (or even just drinking) in a small room of people doing lines. They end up as a bunch of red-faced, bug-eyed sweaty freaks all jockeying for airtime. It's true that when you're doing coke, you feel confident, alert, and sexy, but it's just a matter of hours before you are gurning your face off and are paranoid-delusional with your cock crawling up into your abdomen. You wake up the next morning realizing that you spent the better part of the night finding new and creative ways to excuse yourself to the bathroom, trying to chase the high that you got from your first line and were never able to achieve again.

While most encouraged me, other relationships suffered. My girlfriend, for example, was not as supportive. A pivotal moment in my transformation came the night she and I split. My sweeping changes had been difficult for her. For Ironman, I’d replaced our laid-back mornings with sunrise workouts. Now, I was proposing fewer nights out and to less expensive restaurants. She was upset that I was taking away a sacred pleasure. As she struggled with intense emotion, an airtight connection with internal commitment fortified me. I experienced a Zen-like acceptance. She was in her place, and I in mine; I could release relationships that didn’t nurture my vision.

As Grant points out in his book, successful givers are every bit as ambitious as takers and matchers. They just have a different way of pursuing their objectives. While successful givers mainly focus on acting in the interests of others, they also remain assertive about their own goals and interests. They set healthy boundaries around their time in order to conserve energy and increase their capacity to give. Unsuccessful givers, on the other hand, are passive. They fail to protect their time and other important resources, and suffer burnout and exploitation as a result.

And of course, being in love was the cherry on top. In the past two years, I’d begun to wonder if I’d find a partner for world travel. Happiness is doubled when shared, right? I didn’t make a goal out of finding romance; I figured I would let love happen. But the idea of exploring the world with an intimate companion, of learning and bonding and having fun as we rambled from mountain to city to sea... it was something I wanted.

But the key to happiness has always been within me, I learned. Joy is an inside job. What I discovered in the Berkshires was that happiness is not something to be discovered, but something to create. It’s a byproduct of our mindset and perspective; we don’t find it in external circumstances. We can't control the people or events in our lives, but we can adjust our perspective. In every moment, as long as we remain conscious and aware, we can choose to pick a more positive lens through which to view the world.

My partner, however, was excited about a longer-term adventure, one that intimidated me more than the eight weeks of elbows to the face and shin-kicks that loomed ahead. “When will we have kids?” she asked one day as we walked down from the beach. We had already discussed the topic before we got married, but I wasn’t there yet... I was immersed in the flow of our current adventure. Can’t we just be in the moment? Can't we just live our current adventure? I thought to myself and felt a twinge of discomfort deep down in my stomach. I didn’t want to think about kids and schedules. It felt too soon. I reassured my partner that I’d like to have kids at some point in the future, and that I was open to anything with her. She seemed relatively satisfied with this response—for the moment, at least.

The simplest, most basic practice is to bring awareness to your breath. It’s always here for you. Simply become aware of the sensations of each breath as it flows in and out of your body. That’s it. You don’t have to change how you breath and you can do it for 10 seconds or 10 minutes, sitting or standing, lying down or even walking around. The only thing that really matters is that you focus your attention on the sensory experience. At some point, thoughts will start to arise. Don't try to fight them off, just notice them as they arise and pass, while keeping your attention on the sensation. Trying to block your thoughts can actually do the opposite; it can trigger more thoughts. Remember, what you resist persists.

Love is not enough, it dawned on me one day while driving home. Love may be unconditional, but relationships are not. I’d been compromising on my deepest values to make the relationship work, all the while losing my health and, perhaps more significantly, myself. It was there and then that I knew: our relationship was going to end. There was not a single doubt in my mind this time. I found myself closing my eyes, feeling tears streaming down across my face. Memories flooded within me. I took a deep breath, then another and another, until I finally allowed myself to release. I’m going to be fine.

Love is one of the greatest gifts we can share, but it’s not enough to sustain a long-term relationship. You can genuinely love someone and still be incompatible. We idealize love as the solution to all relationship problems, but the truth is, we all have our boundaries, goals, and desires that we simply can’t compromise. For one person, it might be moving to another country; for another, it might be having kids; and for another, it might be a great sex life.

In fact, the older I grow, the more I realize that life is not just about seeking oneness, but it’s also about uncovering and growing fully into our unique, authentic selves. From my perspective, answering the “Who are you?” question is the main gateway to both contentment and fullness of life. Only when we begin to know ourselves at our core—and to live from that place everyday—can we begin the long, but fulfilling path to self-actualization.

Often, others see qualities and possibilities in us that we cannot see because we’re already immersed in our own experience.

Once you’ve recharged your thinking, it’s time to let go of the problem and let the solutions arise as they will. Many people skip this step, unable to step away from the problem or pursuit, but this release is vital to creative development.

But can I bring all of myself to this marriage? Am I strong enough to be the kind of person that I know I want to be, the kind of man I’ve felt myself to be at certain moments—when self-interest is left behind for investment in others, when responsibility usurps blame, and humor diffuses tension, instead of fearful ego asserting itself for dominance? Am I willing to live in a generous way? Can I be patient with my kids, encouraging them to go out into the world but ensuring their backs are covered, so they have the security and confidence to reach for big things, knowing that someone is there to catch them if they fall short? Am I willing to be interested? Isn’t that what marriage is, a commitment to become the best version of ourselves, a pledge to continually grow toward that ideal, on a daily basis? And then recommitting again when I fail, owning that failure, yet not living in it, but moving through it and stepping farther into partnership. That’s what I’ve been afraid of all these years, that level of investment.

Narcissists will oscillate between feelings of superiority and inferiority.18 Either everyone loves them or everyone hates them. Everything is amazing, or everything is fucked. An event was either the best moment of their lives or traumatizing. With the narcissist, there’s no in-between, because to recognize the nuanced, indecipherable reality before him would require that he relinquish his privileged view that he is somehow special. Mostly, narcissists are unbearable to be around. They make everything about them and demand that people around them do the same.

Summary of Chapter 1 Reading and writing have played immensely important roles in maintaining a progression of culture and knowledge across generations and communities for all of human history, even in the face of recent technological advances in audio and video communication. Books have organically emerged as the standard for transmitting important ideas due to their durability, portability, low-tech design, ability to accommodate long messages, social perception of authority, and inexpensive cost of production. For centuries, the means to print and distribute books profitably was held by relatively few major publishing houses. In recent decades, self-publishing technology has made it easier and cheaper for independent authors to produce, publish, and promote their own work without giving up the royalties or creative control for their work.

As we build up to the 200 metres, and this is a subject that doesn’t get raised very often, because it just doesn’t, but the fact is that not a single white athlete has contested the men’s 100 metres final in the Olympics for thirty-two years. Eighty-two people have broken ten seconds for 100 metres and eighty-one of them have been black; the only one who is white is Christophe Lemaitre of France, who is running tonight in the 200 metres final.

The first time I was searched by the police I was twelve, maybe thirteen years old. There was no adult present and I was not read my rights; this is both completely illegal and entirely normal. Apparently, someone ‘fitting my description’ had robbed someone. During that same year, I saw one of my older friends get chopped in the back of his head several times with a meat cleaver by another boy of his age. That these two trends – illegal and racialised treatment by the state and the attempted murder of one working-class black boy by another – would enter my life for the first time in the same year is more coming of age than coincidence. The violence of the state, the violence of my peers – both integral and inescapable parts of black male adolescence in London.

So I don’t want to give you a romantic picture, it’s not that children are not conscious of race during their primary school years, far from it – it just seems they are more willing to look past the conditioning and the difficulties when making friends than they will be as teenagers.

When you see another group of unfamiliar young black men, everybody is tense, you don’t know yet whether you will give them the black nod or the ‘screw face’ – literally where you screw up your face to try and look scary – whether you’ll holla ‘wa gwan blood’ or ‘where you from cuz?’. The difference could be life changing for all of you.

Then an immense sense of relief descended on me sometime around the age of twenty-five. I know this was not just my experience, I have spoken to so many others who have confirmed that this epiphany is common and murder stats making between eighteen and twenty-two would also seem to bear it out as a real thing.

Which brings us to the elephant in the room; the history of the British class system. Despite all the rhetoric about meritocracy and equality of opportunity, Britain is still – like every nation on earth to some degree – a society where the social class and area you are born into will determine much of your life experiences, chances and outcomes. The quality and type of education you receive, and your likelihood of interaction with police, social workers, prison or other state institutions, will all be influenced by class. If you visit any prison in this – or any – country, the vast majority of its prisoners from any ethnicity you choose will be people from poorer backgrounds, obviously.

There is something about that age – about the combination of puberty and all its sexual confusion and competition, about being old enough to start noticing how fucked up the world is and how many holes there are in your shoes, with the dawning of the reality that your dreams will not come true, that you will most likely be just as unhappy as your parents and that fifty years of dead-end work awaits you – that kills most working-class kids’ confidence.

The clear message of the literature is that, to a significant extent, the exclusion gap is caused by largely unwitting, but systematic, racial discrimination in the application of disciplinary and exclusions policies. Many cite this as evidence of Institutional Racism. The Department has a legal duty to eliminate such discrimination under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.

imported from America a rap-induced mystery nigger gene (similar to the slave sprint one?) that caused black people to kill not for all of the complex reasons that other humans kill, but simply because they are ‘black’, and sometimes because they listened to too much rap, grime or dancehall. This is, after all, what the phrase ‘black-on-black crime’ is designed to suggest, is it not? That black people are not like the rest of humanity, and that they do not kill as a complex result of political, historical, economic, cultural, religious and psychological factors, they kill simply because of their skin: their excessive melanin syndrome. The fact that yellow-on-yellow crime, mixed race-on-mixed race crime or white-on-white violence just sound like joke terms but black on black violence has ‘credibility’ speaks very loudly about the perceived relationship between blackness and depravity in this culture.

In general, relatively few Jews were involved in most of these movements and significant numbers of Jews may have been unaware of their existence. Even Jewish leftist radicalism—surely the most widespread and influential Jewish sub-culture of the 20th century—may have been a minority movement within Jewish communities in the United States and other Western societies for most periods. As a result, when I criticize these movements I am not necessarily criticizing most Jews. Nevertheless, these movements were influential and they were Jewishly motivated.

Prophets challenge the status quo, often earning the hatred of those in power. Wilson therefore deserves to be called a prophet of moral psychology. He was harassed and excoriated in print and in public.18 He was called a fascist, which justified (for some) the charge that he was a racist, which justified (for some) the attempt to stop him from speaking in public. Protesters who tried to disrupt one of his scientific talks rushed the stage and chanted, “Racist Wilson, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide.”19

Many quests begin from a sense of discontent or alienation. If you find yourself feeling discontented, pay attention to the reasons why. Add action to discontent: Find a way to do something about the uncertainty you feel. Asking yourself a series of questions (“What do I want?” “How am I feeling?” and so forth) can help you find your next steps. Chapter

back to the same habits and routine. Several people I spoke with for this book described how, after they’d finished their quests, they’d heard a certain phrase uttered by their friends and family. The phrase was “real life” or “the real world,” and the words were sometimes delivered callously. “Guess you’ll have to get back to real life now” was one way of putting it. “That would never work in the real world” was another. At other times phrases like these were invoked more innocently, perhaps by someone who just couldn’t relate to what had happened during the quest.

The core message is that a quest can bring purpose and meaning to your life, too. Why pursue a quest? Because each of us in our lives is writing our own story, and we only have one chance to get it right. Consider the words of Alicia Ostarello, who recovered from ending a relationship to taking on a dating mission that was simultaneously uncomfortable and enriching. Here’s what she said when the quest was over: “This is my story. No one can take it from me. And that is what has made everything entirely worth it.”

Unhappiness can lead to new beginnings. If you’re not happy with your life, or even if you feel a faint stirring to do something different, pay attention to the dissatisfaction.

The art of following through is something that allows you to create the life that you actually want instead of settling for the life you currently have. It can be said to be composed of four parts: focus, self-discipline, action, and persistence—all equally important. However, it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus doing it. There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start and follow through very often. These reasons can generally be split into two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks. Inhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without even realizing it. They include (1) setting bad goals, (2) procrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and (4) poor time management.

stories of heroes and heroines tell of a journey that takes them from home, across dangerous thresholds, into new, unexplored territories, and then back home with an expanded consciousness. The three phases of this journey—departure, struggle, return—are a metaphor for what happens in us as we evolve from neurotic ego through healthy ego to the spiritual Self. The neurotic ego insists on staying in control and fears the emergence of the Self which says yes to “what is.” The ego’s fear of the Self is conditionality fearing unconditionality. Ironically, this is fear of fearlessness! How the ego can sabotage our integration again and again!

In this book we explore departure and struggle by working through the drama of childhood, by assertiveness (asking for what we want, being clear and taking responsibility for our own feelings), by dealing with fear, anger and guilt, by building self-esteem, by maintaining personal boundaries, by achieving true intimacy, by integrating ourselves flexibly, and by befriending our Shadow. All these processes give us the power to take leave of enclosure in the constricting walls of a scared, clinging ego and cross the threshold into effective, adult living. We then move with a powerful ego (able to handle fear and desire) to a transcendence of ego that makes us unconditionally loving.

With boundaries comes interdependence rather than dependency. With boundaries comes personal accountability, not entitlement to be taken care of unilaterally. From boundaries comes the mutuality that drops control of another in favor of honor of another. Boundaries do not create alienation; they safeguard contiguity. Boundaries are what makes it possible for us to have closeness while we still safely maintain a personal identity.

In other words, our commitment does not mean losing our boundaries. In a neurotic ego investment, we lose our ability to protect ourselves.

driven or possessed by it. The healthy adult allows hurtful events from his past to become neutral facts by fully grieving the pain and so letting go of them. In this way, one retains the memories but drops the charged, obsessive thoughts of hurt that keep one attached to the drama of it all and vitiate healthy relating.

No one creates your feelings. No one is to blame for your situation. You are the author of your condition. Whatever you have been doing is what you are really choosing, whether or not you consciously want it. The alternative is to see yourself as a victim of people or circumstances and real change becomes impossible. Taking responsibility always leads to a revelation of what your next step needs to be.

Negative excitement is a stressful form of pain in which we fear and desire the same object at the same time. It is an addictive energy that usually stems from old emotional business that has been activated by the dramatic complications in our life story. Negative excitement can keep us stuck for years in dysfunctional, abusive, or self-defeating circumstances. It sometimes feels like a sense of purpose since it sustains our ongoing drama. When the object of our negative excitement is gone, we may then feel depressed and even believe our life has lost meaning.

If you fear someone you cannot trust, change your situation by leaving it or handling the fear within your own support system (friends, therapy, etc.) It takes courage to admit your limits and not damage yourself by staying in no-win stress and pain. Endurance of such humiliation erodes self-esteem and keeps you afraid.

Primal fears arise in childhood that carry over into adult relationships: • Fear of being abandoned and so losing the other; this makes us cling or be possessive of others. • Fear of being engulfed and so losing oneself; this makes us run away or distance ourselves from others.

If the result of this process is that you feel wrong, then the point has been missed. We give the gift of being right because being right just does not matter. The need to be right is a form of holding on which is based on fear. Giving the gift of letting someone else be right compassionately allows both of you to relax. The fear eases away and the humor is released. Then the mutual trust level increases.

Grieving occurs best in the gap that opens in your life once you are alone. It cannot proceed while you are involved with someone new. When a relationship has ended, the healthy adult allows adequate time alone for working through grief and for processing what has been learned. Time elapses and then readiness for a new relationship occurs. One neither seeks nor avoids but lets it come unsought. This is trusting the synchronous timing of the universe over inner urgency or social pressures.

INTEGRATING THE POSITIVE SHADOW To integrate the positive Shadow is to acknowledge our own untapped potential behind the awe we have of others. We begin to acknowledge and to release from within ourselves the very talents and qualities we admired in others. At first this means “acting as if” but soon we act with ease and even more of our hidden powers become accessible to us. We expend effort and then grace takes over.

We have heard about the harm our childhood wounds can do to our adult relationships, but I take a generally positive view of the childhood phase of our human journey. What happened to us then is not as important as how we hold it now: positively as something we have grown by or negatively as something that goes on wounding us and our relationships. If we can mourn the past and thereby diminish its impact on our present lives, we can then maintain our boundaries while still bonding closely to a partner. As long as we have a program for dealing with adversity, no problem can lead us to despair.

The key to effective engraving is to create an intense connection: to watch and listen so closely that you can imagine the feeling of performing the skill. For physical skills, project yourself inside the performer’s body. Become aware of the movement, the rhythm; try to feel the interior shape of the moves. For mental skills, simulate the skill by re-creating the expert’s decision patterns. Chess players achieve this by replaying classic games, move by move; public speakers do it by regiving great speeches complete with original inflections;

But being willing to be stupid—in other words, being willing to risk the emotional pain of making mistakes—is absolutely essential, because reaching, failing, and reaching again is the way your brain grows and forms new connections.

When you learn hard skills, be precise and measured. Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to errors, and fix them, particularly at the start. Learning fundamentals only seems boring—in fact, it’s the key moment of investment. If you build the right pathway now, you’ll save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the line.

Precision especially matters early on, because the first reps establish the pathways for the future. Neurologists call this the “sled on a snowy hill” phenomenon. The first repetitions are like the first sled tracks on fresh snow: On subsequent tries, your sled will tend to follow those grooves. “Our brains are good at building connections,” says Dr. George Bartzokis, a neurologist at UCLA. “They’re not so good at unbuilding them.”

When you practice a soft skill, focus on making a high number of varied reps, and on getting clear feedback. Don’t worry too much about making errors—the important thing is to explore. Soft skills are often more fun to practice, but they’re also tougher because they demand that you coach yourself. After each session ask yourself, What worked? What didn’t? And why?

They resist the temptation of complexity and work on the task of honing and maintaining their hard skills, because those form—quite literally—the foundation of everything else.

Then work on the branches.

Interesting people aren’t interested in being interesting. They’re deeply interested in some part of the world around them—in learning karate, or in brewing the perfect cup of coffee, or in watercolor painting, or in travel—and that passion rubs off on the people around them.

This is what we do when we plan. We absorb what is most important to us about travel and exploration as pursuits worthy unto themselves, so that when we land on terra incognita, and the bus is late or the hostel is full or the border is closed, we know what to do. The road is about learning to let go of all our plans, no matter how large or small, so we can grab hold of those serendipitous moments that turn into lifelong memories.

Just like well-laid plans, it’s a romantic, reassuring idea that helps you get on the road but falls apart once it runs into real life. Few things push a person so completely and unceremoniously out of their comfort zone like solo travel. When you are with a tour group or friends, you can rely on someone else to do all the heavy lifting. Someone else can make the plans, talk to people, find the train station, navigate, keep track of money, or tend to you when you are sick. When you’re solo, you have to do it all. You only have you. You have to figure out how to talk to people if you want to make friends. You have to figure out how to get to the airport, or your hostel, or how to find the right bus, or a good doctor. You have to figure out who is trustworthy or who is going to scam you. It’s all on you—and that forces you to learn about people and places in a way you simply don’t when you travel with others. Traveling solo, you learn who you are and what you are capable of. You learn how to be comfortable with only your own thoughts for companionship. In this sense, solo travel is a wonderful teacher, because it teaches self-reliance.

But, on the other hand, as richly rewarding as traveling alone can be, it has its costs and its downsides, as well. As you wander, eat, and sit in bars alone, you come to realize that traveling with no one but yourself for company can be its own kind of trial. Eventually the thrill of solitude wears off. Your mouth becomes dry from lack of use, and you forget how to have a good conversation. You turn to share experiences with someone only to realize there is no one there. Your aloneness has become loneliness.

The promise that we’re going to interact with the people in our lives day after day keeps us civil—we don’t break the rules today, even if we want to, because we know we’re going to have to deal with the consequences tomorrow. But on the road, there’s no guarantee you’ll see that person tomorrow (or ever again), so the only thing keeping you civil is whatever self-restraint you happen to internalize. I love the freedom of travel, but I also realize that, while it can bring out the best in us—our sense of adventurousness, curiosity, and creativity—it can also sometimes bring out the worst.

There you are. You enter your hostel or guesthouse, strike up a conversation with another traveler, and just like that you’re best friends. You hang out, eat, drink and sightsee together for days. For that time and place, you two (or three or four) do everything together and joke as if you had been friends forever. You’re besties. There is no past or future. Nothing about who you were back home, how old you are, what you do for work, your last relationship, or where you’re from matters.

As for the people at a desk—well, they’re not as awful as I’d imagined them, either. I had built an image in my head that came with youthful ignorance—and that age toned down. Some of my best friends have opted for the settled life, the life of minivans, suburbs, 2.5 kids, steady jobs, and 401(k) plans. That choice is right for them. And there’s nothing wrong with choosing a rooted, settled life if you choose it consciously, deliberately. So many of us do the opposite, though. We choose that life because it’s the only option we see, or because we’re scared out of considering alternatives, and then we spend the rest of our lives resenting our choice, because really it wasn’t a choice at all. And, in a vicious cycle, we try to dull our resentment by casting those who opt out as crazy, as not-normals.

jail before buying his way out with five thousand dollars. So what’s it like inside a Congolese prison? “I had money, so it was no problem. I had my friends bring me food every day and also food for many of the others inside, so I was popular and allowed to sleep peacefully each night.” The subject of poverty finally stirs Henri’s scant sense of public relations. “Congo is one of the richest countries in the world,” he insists. “Here you have oil, uranium, diamonds, gold, all in abundance.” “Well, potentially, one of the richest countries in the world,” I interject. “Yes, right, one of the richest.” Henri has been in the Congo fifteen years. Living in France in 1992, he tried to import tropical fish from the Congo to sell to aquarium owners around Europe. He found a supplier and set up a large order. Between the fish, shipping fees, insurance, customs bribes, dock and loading charges, taxes, agent commissions, and other costs associated with the maddening world of import/export, Henri sunk twenty-five thousand dollars’ worth of francs into his first shipment.2 All of his fish arrived on time. All were dead. “My supplier had no idea how to pack fish for shipment,” he tells me. “The insurance company refused to cover my loss because it turns out this guy had faked his paperwork. He was not even a licensed vendor.” Outraged and nearly broke, Henri flew to Kinshasa to confront his vendor and was quickly consumed by the country.

To retrieve the past and to undo the past are our paradoxical goals in relationships. No wonder they are so complex! Their complexity is not about the transactions between two adults but the fact that such transactions never begin: instead, two children are tugging at each other’s sleeve, shouting in unison, “Look what happened to me when I was a kid! Make it stop, and make it better for me!” In effect, we are asking an innocent bystander to repair a problem he has no knowledge of and little skill to repair. And all the time and energy that goes into that transaction distracts us from the first part of our work: repairing our own lives.

Finally free, my mission was to find all the gaps in the system. I would go beyond Tim Ferriss’s version of geoarbitrage – using cheap production and labor in one part of the world and selling to high-paying customers in the West – and delve deeper into the global economy to leverage everything it had to offer. I would visit the world’s emerging hot spots, places that few were talking about, and discover the opportunities that still fewer could even imagine. In doing so, I would create the conditions for my ultimate personal freedom and economic prosperity.

To thrive in an ever-globalizing world, you must do what others do not do and go where others will not go. The world economy is changing and those who operate at the edges of this new economy will find the greatest success. The focus should not be on surviving, but on actually thriving; on enjoying the best of life.

We all want to live our best life possible. That has not changed. What has changed in the last eighty years are the means by which we can achieve that goal.

Takeaway: Those of us that live by principles of self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and global diversification will not only prosper, but prosper on a far more consistent basis than those who have tied themselves to one economy. While investing in a foreign stock or mutual fund was enough in the 1990s, Nomad Capitalists operate on an entirely new level of savvy diversification by going where they’re treated best.

Building your personal list of focus cities takes time, so this is a strategy that is best used by recovering perpetual travelers, or people who are willing to visit a rotation of cities frequently enough to get used to them. It has taken me almost a decade to develop my list of focus city candidates: Dublin, Warsaw, Brussels, Riga, Tbilisi, Istanbul, Panama City, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Phnom Penh.

Once you find someone to create a life with, there is no need to give up the Nomad Capitalist lifestyle.

It is easy for many of us to recognize that our lives are not exactly perfect at the moment, but it is much harder for us to make a change if we cannot see that the future will be perfect. We tie ourselves to a mindset in which it is better to accept where we are, as unhappy as we may be, than to take a chance on a future that is uncertain, even if it is certainly much better.

Just like the guy who yelled at me for wanting him to feel more pain before things got better, I frequently encourage people to sit in the pain. Merely dulling the pain may feel good, but it is not a recipe for success. Instead, use that pain to transform your life and get more of what you want and less of what you do not. Acknowledge and use the pain you are experiencing to transform and create a long-term positive change.

The best way to stop spending time on unnecessary distractions is to make a “to-stop-doing list.” This is better than a to-do list, because it helps you see what’s bringing you down. Your to-stop-doing list is exactly what it sounds like: a list of things you simply don’t want to do anymore.

All those good things you’ve done before are nice, but the future can be even better. Focus on that. • Increase the percentage of legacy work as opposed to busywork (or even just “good work”). • Setting a continual metric (like the 1,000-words standard) can help keep you focused on what really matters to you. • Wake up in the middle of the night with good ideas. Share them with the world.

Living a happy life or a life you love might seem like a really foreign concept right now, or you might be saying, “I don’t really know what makes me happy.” Don’t worry, you’re not alone. Many people don’t know what makes them happy—they just want more time, space, and freedom to figure it out. Or they want to get out of the rat race as quickly as possible, and that’s cool, too.

I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. (Measure of the avoidant attachment style) • I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn’t really love me or won’t want to stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person and this desire sometimes scares people away. (Measure of the anxious attachment style) Remarkably,

Extraordinary benefits accrue to the tiny minority of people who are able to push just a tiny bit longer than most. Extraordinary benefits also accrue to the tiny majority with the guts to quit early and refocus their efforts on something new. In both cases, it’s about being the best in the world. About getting through the hard stuff and coming out on the other side. Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other. The Best in the World Hannah Smith is a very lucky woman. She’s a law clerk at the Supreme Court. She’s the best in the world. Last year, more than forty-two thousand people graduated from law school in the United States. And thirty-seven of them were awarded Supreme Court clerkships. Those

Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations. Reactive quitting and serial quitting are the bane of those that strive (and fail) to get what they want. And most people do just that. They quit when it’s painful and stick when they can’t be bothered to quit.

There’s not a lot to say about the Cul-de-Sac except to realize that it exists and to embrace the fact that when you find one, you need to get off it, fast. That’s because a dead end is keeping you from doing something else. The opportunity cost of investing your life in something that’s not going to get better is just too high.

The challenge is simple: Quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea. If the journey you started was worth doing, then quitting when you hit the Dip just wastes the time you’ve already invested. Quit in the Dip often enough and you’ll find yourself becoming a serial quitter, starting many things but accomplishing little.

Because if your order book is 80 percent filled with prospects where you just sort of show up, you’re not only wasting your time, you’re also stealing your energy from the 20 percent of the calls where you have a chance to create a breakthrough.

You’re Astonishing How dare you waste it. You and your organization have the power to change everything. To create remarkable products and services. To over deliver. To be the best in the world. How dare you squander that resource by spreading it too thin. How dare you settle for mediocre just because you’re busy coping with too many things on your agenda, racing against the clock to get it all done. The lesson is simple: If you’ve got as much as you’ve got, use it. Use it to become the best in the world, to change the game, to set the agenda for everyone else. You can only do that by marshaling all of your resources to get through the biggest possible Dip. In order to get through that Dip, you’ll need to quit everything else. If it’s not going to put a dent in the world, quit. Right now. Quit and use that void to find the energy to assault the Dip that matters.

“People are completely mispredicting when breaking up an experience would benefit them,” the researchers found. It seems that just the mere act of interrupting happy experiences gives us joy because it stifles our natural inclination to get used to an experience. The interruption forces us to realize what we’ve adapted to and resets our excitement to experience it all over again.

In this book I will teach you how to create a system of knowledge management, or a “Second Brain.”* Whether you call it a “personal cloud,” “field notes,” or an “external brain” as some of my students have done, it is a digital archive of your most valuable memories, ideas, and knowledge to help you do your job, run your business, and manage your life without having to keep every detail in your head. Like a personal library in your pocket, a Second Brain enables you to recall everything you might want to remember so you can achieve anything you desire.

At one point some of my colleagues asked me to teach them my organizing methods. I found that virtually all of them already used various productivity tools, such as paper notepads or the apps on their smartphones, but that very few did so in a systematic, intentional way. They tended to move information around from place to place haphazardly, reacting to the demands of the moment, never quite trusting that they’d be able to find it again.

Adopting the habit of knowledge capture has immediate benefits for our mental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will fail us at a crucial moment. Instead of jumping at every new headline and notification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives and consciously let go of the rest.

A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. We compile tons of research, but never put forward our own proposal. We gather untold business case studies, but never pitch one potential client. We study every piece of relationship advice available, but never ask anyone out on a date.

Capturing excerpts from online articles or web pages: When you come across an online article or blog post you want to read, save it to a “read later” app, which is like a digital magazine rack of everything you want to read (or watch or listen to) at some point. Whenever you have some free time (such as on breaks or in the evening after work), scroll through the articles you’ve saved and pick one to read. You can make highlights, just as with ebooks, and they can also be automatically exported to your notes app using a third-party platform.

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future self* —by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle.

Distilling makes our ideas small and compact, so we can load them up into our minds with minimal effort. If you can’t locate a piece of information quickly, in a format that’s convenient and ready to be put to use, then you might as well not have it at all. Our most scarce resource is time, which means we need to prioritize our ability to quickly rediscover the ideas that we already have in our Second Brain.

Start by saving only the best excerpts from that piece of content in a new note, either using copy-paste or a capture tool. This is layer one, the initial excerpts you save in your Second Brain. Next, read through the excerpts, bolding the main points and most important takeaways. Don’t make it an analytical decision—listen for a feeling of resonance and let that be your guide for what to bold. These bolded passages are layer two. Now read through only the bolded passages, and highlight (or, if your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature, underline) the best of the best passages. The key here is to be very picky: the entire note may have only a few highlighted sentences, or even just one. Not only is that fine, it represents a highly distilled and discoverable note. These highlights are layer three, which is distilled enough for most use cases. The true test of whether a note you’ve created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance. Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to revisit it once you’ve forgotten most of the details. When you come back to it, give yourself no more than thirty seconds and see if you can rapidly get up to speed on what it’s about using the highlights you previously made. You’ll quickly be able to tell if you’ve added too many highlights or too few.

Big projects and goals become less intimidating because you can just keep breaking them down into smaller and smaller pieces, until they fit right into the gaps in your day. Third, Intermediate Packets increase the quality of your work by allowing you to collect feedback more often. Instead of laboring for weeks in isolation, only to present your results to your boss or client and find out you went in the wrong direction, you craft just one small building block at a time and get outside input before moving forward. You’ll find that people give much better feedback if they’re included early, and the work is clearly in progress. Fourth, and best of all, eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity. The idea of starting anything from scratch will become foreign to you—why not draw on the wealth of assets you’ve invested in in the past? People will marvel at how you’re able to deliver at such a high standard so consistently. They’ll wonder how you find the time to do so much careful thinking, when in fact you’re not working harder or longer—all you’re doing is drawing on a growing library of Intermediate Packets stored in your Second Brain. If they are truly valuable assets, then they deserve to be managed, just like any other asset you possess. Intermediate Packets are really a new lens through which you can perceive the atomic units that make up everything you do. By “thinking small,” you can focus on creating just one IP each time you

People ask me, “How do I get tougher?” BE TOUGHER. “How can I wake up early in the morning?” WAKE UP EARLY. “How can I work out consistently every day?” WORK OUT CONSISTENTLY EVERY DAY. “How can I stop eating sugar?” STOP EATING SUGAR.

You have to decide that you are going to be in control, that you are going to do what YOU want to do. Weakness doesn’t get a vote. Laziness doesn’t get a vote. Sadness doesn’t get a vote. Frustration doesn’t get a vote. Negativity DOESN’T GET A VOTE! Your temper doesn’t get a vote. So next time you are feeling weak or lazy or soft or emotional, tell those feelings they don’t get a vote. You are declaring martial law on your mind:

What forward progress have I made? Who have I helped? What am I doing to improve myself—today? To get better, faster, stronger, healthier, smarter? Is this what I want to be? This?

GET OUT OF BED. I don’t like procrastination. But if you feel like you need a break—that is one thing you should procrastinate. Taking a break is the one thing I put off until tomorrow. And if—when tomorrow comes—you still feel like you need rest or you need a break—then go ahead: Take it. Chances are you won’t—you won’t need that rest. Chances are you will realize that the desire to rest was just weakness—it was the desire to take the path of least resistance—the downhill path—the downward path.

In combat, focus comes pretty easily because the battle is right in front of your face. You have no choice but to focus. But, sometimes, in day-to-day life, you can lose track of the long-term goal. It fades from your vision. It slips from your mind. WRONG. I want that long-term goal to be so embedded in my mind, that I never lose sight of it. EVER. And the little tasks and projects and short-term goals that you tackle need to lead toward strategic victory—winning the long war.

SUMMARY Reality is manifest in an infinite variety of forms. Variability is the world’s most fundamental quality. Any model of the universe represents just one manifestation of reality. Any branch of knowledge bases itself on one chosen aspect of the manifestation of reality. Your choice is always realized. You always receive what you choose. The alternatives space is an information field recording all that was, is and ever will be. The information field contains potential alternative scenarios to any event. Each alternative has a script and scenery. Space can be divided into sectors and each sector contains an alternative scenario of an event. The greater the distance between sectors, the more the alternatives will differ. Sectors with roughly uniform parameters are arranged in a life line. Material realisation moves through space like a bundle of density. The radiation of thought energy materializes an alternative. Every organism contributes to the creation of material realization. When the parameters of thought energy change, a shift occurs to a different life line. You cannot change the fact that scenery exists, but you can choose a different type of scenery. You do not have to fight for happiness. You simply have to choose an alternative reality that is more to your liking. Chapter II. PENDULUMS Rent Yourself Out Destructive pendulums We are taught from childhood to obey the will of others, to perform our duties, serve our country, our family, the company we work for, a political party, the state, or even an idea; to serve anyone except ourselves. To varying degrees, everyone has a sense of duty, responsibility, necessity and guilt. Everyone is ready to serve a group or organization in one way or another, be it family, a club, school, company, political party, the state and so on. All these structures emerge and develop when a separate group of people begin to think and act in the same way. Then, they are joined by others and the structure grows, gaining strength, forcing its members to follow the rules and eventually amassing the potential to gain control over large groups of society. On the material level the structure consists of a group of people united by common goals and material objects, such as buildings, furniture, equipment, machinery, technology and so on.

By our mid-30s or 40s, when the personality is complete, we have experienced much of what life has to offer. And as a result, we can pretty much anticipate the outcome of most experiences; we already know how they’re going to feel before we engage in them. Because we’ve had several good and bad relationships, we’ve competed in business or settled into our career, we’ve suffered loss and encountered success, or we know what we like and dislike, we know the nuances of life. Since we can predict the likely emotions ahead of an actual experience, we determine whether we want to experience that “known” event before it actually occurs. Of course, all of this is happening behind the scenes of our awareness.

A Different Midlife: A Time for Facing Feelings and Letting Go of Illusions At this time of life, other people who don’t strive to keep their feelings buried ask some big questions: Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Where am I going? Who am I doing all of this for? What is God? Where do I go when I die? Is there more to life than “success”? What is happiness? What does all this mean? What is love? Do I love myself? Do I love anyone else? And the soul begins to wake up…. These types of questions begin to occupy the mind because we see through the illusion and suspect that nothing outside of us can ever make us happy. Some of us ultimately realize that nothing in our environment is going to “fix” the way we feel. We also recognize the enormous amount of energy it takes to keep up this projection of self as an image to the world, and how exhausting it is to keep the mind and body constantly preoccupied. Eventually we come to see that our futile attempt to maintain an ideal for others is really a strategy to make sure that those impending feelings we’ve been running from never capture us.

you know, one of the key skills you need to develop is self-awareness/self-observation. That’s a shortcut definition of what I mean when I talk about meditation in the next chapter. In meditation, you’re going to look at the negative emotional state that has had such an impact on your life. You’re going to recognize the primary state of your personality that drives your thoughts and behaviors so that you become intimately familiar with every nuance of them. Over time, you’re going to use those powers of observation to help you unmemorize that negative emotional state. By doing so, you will surrender that emotion to a greater mind, closing the gap between who you are and who you have presented to the world in the past.

Once you start creating filters in your mind, even if there is truth to some of them, those beliefs can become limiters. We start to look at ourselves from the outside in—through the filters—and begin to see examples around us that confirm it. Soon, the beliefs minimize our ability to do things that otherwise might have been amazing.

As I stated earlier, the main purpose of meditating is to remove your attention from the environment, your body, and the passage of time so that what you intend, what you think, becomes your focus instead of these externals. You can then change your internal state independent of the outside world. Meditating is also a means for you to move beyond your analytical mind so that you can access your subconscious mind. That’s crucial, since the subconscious is where all your bad habits and behaviors that you want to change reside.

When I began to research quantum physics I started to understand the observer effect and the ways that light itself can be both particle and wave. I learned how we are creating reality on subatomic and molecular levels, and most likely on much larger levels than that. I discovered superpositional states and the way that parallel realities exist around us and within us that can be accessed through information fields. How a source field can contain the information of all of existence, everything imaginable, every single action that I could possibly take.

The next portal into subtle states of consciousness is silence—the silence of the voice within. The inner voice constantly chatters throughout the day, reminding us of important duties, cajoling us to like this and dislike that. It inspires us and judges us and others. It feels the need to perpetually narrate, comment on, and label the events of life. There are so many voices as we listen deeply. With practice, we learn to quiet these voices. Eventually, they go silent, first for moments, then as a sustained state of consciousness. So, silence is another portal to subtle states of consciousness. In silence, you let go of the stress of overthinking. There is a nurturing comfort in silence.

For example, your state of consciousness determines if you are stressed out or calm, grateful or critical, compassionate or angry, connected or isolated, guided and inspired, or confused and wandering aimlessly. Your state of consciousness can be reactive, judgmental, and hostile, or attentive, discerning, and kind. There are an infinite number of possible ways you can relate to the events of life. Your state of consciousness determines how you relate to what is happening now, as well as what happened in the past, or what might happen in the future.

A good place to feel the sensations of breathing is in your lower abdomen, a spot far away from your thinking/analyzing/external-information-processing brain. The thinking mind tends to be consumed by outer information and thoughts about all this information without being able to free itself to do anything else. So, to counter this, you can establish your attention in a place far away from this mental chatter, a place such as your lower abdomen. You can put your hands on your abdomen to reinforce this focal point.

Summary of the Interoceptive Process Here’s a summary of the intuitive process we’ve just described: Pause. Close your eyes. Turn inward to the subtle sensations in your lower abdomen of breathing. Count your out-breaths in cycles of 10 to relax and focus internally. Tune in to your gut sense and notice information that “lights up” in the space inside or around you.   Through this process of awakening your inner senses, you become a conscious radio operator, tuning to the frequencies of inner wisdom and letting the outer noise dissolve in the background. We’re going to practice interoception and apply it to gather information pertaining to the five introductory questions in a couple of exercises at the end of this chapter.

Second, that we are not separate from the world around us. In all of our technological advancements, we have forgotten this primordial wisdom. We are not solid, separate things existing in parallel. All creatures and concepts on this planet are inherently connected, constantly interacting with each other on quantum levels as well as at a larger scale. To extend this a step further: at one point in time, the particles inside of us could have been entangled all the way back to the beginning of time. All of the atoms and chemicals that exploded from our pea-sized universe in the Big Bang were connected—which means we may well be connected to the very stars we see in the sky. This is something that is difficult to write or speak about, but that we understand on a very deep, internal level.

Subtle Energy Meditation begins as many forms of meditation begin, by closing your eyes, letting go of external perceptions, and focusing inside. It then proceeds from very physical and tangible sensations such as posture points and breath awareness to more subtle sensations of subtle energy flow through points and paths within your body. It expands from these points and paths into sensing the entire energy field of your body and then into sensing the Infinite Field of energy and information within you and all around you.

Finally, it leads beyond all forms of energy and information. All forms dissolve into a formless Field of Potentiality, Possibility, and Pure Awareness. At this point, there’s an experience beyond space and time, beyond the tensions of self, in a Formless Field of Being. As you rest in this Field, all the stress of living as an individual in a world of rigidly defined demands dissolves.

When you think about meditation, you might think of a technique for relaxation and focusing attention. Meditation is getting lots of attention these days for its ability to activate the body’s relaxation response, while boosting mindfulness—the ability to pay attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally, like a curious observer.

How can you gently ease into this Pure Awareness? It begins as you commit to a daily practice in which you set aside everything you think you have to do, let go of the outside world, and focus inside. If you truly want to connect with and live from this deeper state of consciousness, it takes a consistent daily commitment. Your ability to tune in to it requires the cultivation of finer inner senses—senses that are dormant if you are accustomed to only paying attention to input from your five outer senses.

During this daily practice of inward sensing, you’ll need to have a quiet space, sit in a relaxed upright posture, close your eyes, and focus in on the sensations inside your body. You can begin by becoming aware of any tension in your body and using your mind to let go and relax these areas. Next, you can focus on the sensations of breathing. A good place to do this is in your abdomen, noticing the subtle sensations of expansion and relaxation. It’s important to really feel these sensations, as if they are the most fascinating event in the world. After all, breathing is sustaining your life. It’s amazing how this happens without you having to pay attention.

However, when you do pay attention—and notice the entire cycle of your breathing, from the moment you begin to inhale, until you naturally pause, to the moment you begin to exhale, until you naturally pause—you start to feel at ease with this natural rhythm. Whenever your attention wanders, which it will, you recognize what grabbed your attention, release it, and return to feeling the sensations of breathing. As you do this again and again, you become completely absorbed in the sensations of breathing, and everything else fades to the background.

In Qigong Meditation (one of the primary styles of Subtle Energy Meditation, along with Kriya Yoga) the teaching is simple: gather more energy than you expend. When you look at this, it really is common sense. If you are expending all the energy you have, you deplete yourself. You have nothing left over. The mere thought of doing one more thing, such as taking 20 to 30 minutes to elevate your state of consciousness through meditation, is just too much.

2. Wake up 25 minutes earlier and center yourself using prayer, affirmations, or meditation. How do you feel when you wake up in the morning? No matter how you feel, you’ll feel much better if you take the first few minutes upon waking to center your mind. What if you start doing this now, starting tomorrow? Meditating first thing in the morning is a powerful way to start your day in a relaxed, empowered, energized way. If you don’t meditate first thing, it’s likely it won’t happen later, as you’ll get involved in everything you need to get done in the day.

What if you affirm the deeper qualities you would like to live from, such as peace, love, joy, compassion, and empowerment using simple, positive, present-tense statements.

Seven Blessings With the preceding preparation tips in mind, it’s time to introduce the next meditation in our series, called “Seven Blessings.” The purpose of this meditation is to cultivate postural alignment, spinal energy flow, and subtle energy awareness.

We also suggest you continue to log your practice using the Meditation Log in the Appendices. For each session, log the day and time, and the name of the meditation you did. Add a brief description of the inner cues you found significant. (An example of this could be, “Become aware of all seven chakras at once, like a string of pearls from the base of your spine through the top of your head.”) Add a brief description of your inner felt experience of these significant cues. (An example of this could be, “I felt an electric sensation up through my whole spine.”) Finally, rate your Energy, Mood, and Mental Clarity on a scale from 0 to 10.

The ladder of success seems to have three main steps: (1) Initially, it’s what one “has” that counts—that is, status depends upon visible signs of material wealth; (2) as one progresses, status is afforded by what one “does,” rather than what one has—at this level on the ladder, one’s position and activities bring significant social status, but the attraction of social roles loses glamour as one achieves mastery and matures, for it’s what one has accomplished that is important; (3) and finally, one is concerned only with what one has become as a result of life’s experiences—such people have a charismatic “presence” that is the outer manifestation of the grace of their inner power. In their company, we feel the effect of the powerful attractor energy patterns that they’re aligned with and that they reflect. Success comes as the automatic consequence of aligning one’s life with high-power energy patterns.

On our scale of consciousness, there are two critical points that allow for major advancement. The first is at 200, the initial level of empowerment: Here, the willingness to stop blaming and accept responsibility for one’s own actions, feelings, and beliefs arises—as long as cause and responsibility are projected outside of oneself, one will remain in the powerless mode of victimhood. The second is at the 500 level, which is reached by accepting love and nonjudgmental forgiveness as a lifestyle, exercising unconditional kindness to all persons, things, and events without exception.

How we react depends upon the world we’re reacting to. Who we become, as well as what we see, is determined by perception—which can be said, simply, to create the world. It’s interesting to note that the further down the scale of consciousness a person is, the harder it is for him to maintain eye contact; at the low end, visual contact is avoided altogether. In contrast, as we go up the scale, the ability to hold prolonged, and finally almost endless, gazes at great depth becomes characteristic. We’re all familiar with the guarded glance of guilt, the glare of hostility, and the unblinking open-eyed-ness of innocence. Remember that power and perception go hand in hand. The Mechanics of Perception How, then, does perception work? What are its mechanics? That perception is subjectively unique is evidenced by common observation:We’re all familiar with the example of a mock trial in law school, wherein different witnesses relate wildly divergent accounts of the same event. The mechanism of perception is like a movie theater where the projector is consciousness itself. The forms on the film are the attractor energy patterns, and the moving pictures on the screen are the world that we perceive and call “reality.”We could say that the configurations on the film are the ABC attractor fields in mind and the moving picture on the screen is the A B C observed as the phenomenal world. This schema provides a model for a better understanding of the nature of causality, which occurs on the level of the film, not the level of the screen. Because the world routinely applies its efforts to the screen of life at the level ofA B C, these endeavors are ineffectual and costly. Causality stems from the attractor patterns of levels of energy, the ABCs of the configurations imprinted on the film of mind, illuminated by consciousness. The

Imagine hundreds of highways beside each other, stretching out in front of you. While these highways lead to destinations or come from destinations the highways themselves are the destination in and of themselves, meaning the starting point or ending point of a highway contains a similar experience to any other point of the highway in between. Each highway represents a unique life experience, options you could decide for. Each of these highways represents a different version-of-yourself. Each highway contains experiences, props, people, sceneries, background, emotions that are distinct and different from the other highways (on some there are similarities or overlapping). Each time you make a decision or change your decision, you change your direction on the highway or towards another one of these many highways. You may move forward, backwards, to the right to the left, to the side of the highway or even switch over to another highway. From the viewpoint of Infinity all of these

highways are not actually lined up beside each other. They are also not stacked up on top of each other. From the Viewpoint of Infinity they are all taking up the same space at the same time, in a sense. There not even linear highways anymore. But for practical reasons, and in an earthly context, let’s see them as highways lined up beside each other, representing timelines of different versions of yourself.

Some of you are on highways containing experiences and leading to destinations that you like, some of you are on highways containing sceneries and experiences you dislike. Most highways are a mix of both. Some of you are moving very quickly on any chosen highway, others are moving slowly, enjoying or enduring the scenery. Others are sitting at the side of the road, having stopped to take a break, to become silent and contemplate what they have experienced on their highway or which highway to take next. Others are sitting on the side of the highway because they don’t know where to go. Others still stand at crossroads, a fork in the road, facing a decision about the further path. Too many are still walking or driving down a highway in the mistaken belief that this is the only highway that exists or that it’s the only highway they are able or allowed to take.

Infinity splits itself into many different viewpoints or “I am” s. Each of these viewpoints are at the same time a part of infinity (containing the whole) and separate, individual viewpoints. To make an infinitely long story short: You are such a split off, individual viewpoint, coming from the creator (infinity), containing all the potential of the creator (holographically), but also having a relationship to the creator (because of your separateness). From your original individual “I am” viewpoint, which is only separate once you split off several more viewpoints: “I am this”, “I am that”, “I am also that”. Each word you place after the original “I am” allows you to incarnate into a certain reality (plane, dimension, planet, atmosphere, galaxy, surrounding, universe, place, time, event, experience). Each reality you incarnate into has a certain context, meaning limitations or “game rules”.

In “modern” western society this “working” often involves going to some office cubicle and sitting in front of a screen. In their “freetime”, when they are not working “in order to get money, in order to survive” what do they do? Many of them sit in front of other screens…be it the TV, the Movie Theatre, or the Internet. Others will eat or drink, some of them going to restaurants or cafes or pubs to do so. Others might go out into nature and walk around or do any type of sports or go visit other people. Yet others may have sex. Very few will be doing something creative or spiritual. Even fewer will be going into the unknown, meaning perceiving or doing something that has not been done before. But once you reawaken your Infinite Self even these commonplace things and places will become interesting again…because you will notice that there are an unlimited number of Versions of a single event.

You exist in two basic states: As Identity, as an Individual Soul, as an “I am” and as the whole, as Infinity or as Infinite Self. Everything is One, and you are that One. Just like a the tiniest part of a Hologram contains all the Information of the whole Hologram, you contain all the Information of the Universes and are connected to “all that exists”. Nothing can be added to or taken away from infinity, since infinity already contains everything. This implies that your very existence is proof that you have always existed and will always exist. And what does not exist has never existed and will never exist. In this sense, there is no such thing as non-existence (so relax…you will never die). You will exist (in various forms) forever. You exist as a being that is aware of itself, has free will and access to everything and anything else that exists. You are Infinite, and the rest is changing.

The Law of Correspondence means “like attracts like”, “you can only experience what you are”, “what you give is what you get”, “one kind of vibration attracts other types of like vibrations”, “birds of a feather flock together”, “what you put out is what comes back to you”. If you want something in life – anything – you have to be someone who corresponds to that.

At first, most people notice just how busy and distracted their minds are. It seems impossible to ignore distracting thoughts; they find themselves just sitting there worrying and/or wondering how this is supposed to be relaxing, calming, and quieting for their mind. Many people give up on meditation before they get far into it, thinking that they just aren’t good at it or that it’s just not for them.

This is the normal rhythm of a healthy life: you experience demands, find the resources to handle them, and then return to relaxation and recovery. An empowered, purposeful, fulfilling life has a natural rhythm between periods of healthy challenge and recovery.

Any situation that goes unresolved gets stored as tension in your body. This tension may go unnoticed as you move on to other events and experiences, yet it stays with you, subtly influencing how you think, feel, and behave in the future. As a situation remains unresolved and/or unresolved stressors pile up, your body moves into the next stage of stress response.

In the Resistance Stage, you may notice yourself being persistently fatigued, more susceptible to nagging colds, slower to heal from injuries, and more emotionally on edge. You may find it easier to “fly off the handle,” be subject to periods of “brain fog” in which you find it hard to concentrate, get caught up in cravings for salty or sweet comfort foods, and be more at risk for addictions to alcohol and narcotics that numb your feelings. Getting some extra sleep, eating well, exercising, and consciously relaxing through activities such as meditation can help you stay afloat in this phase. By doing these activities, you can actively manage the Resistance Stage for quite some time—even for years. If you are able to make significant life changes to prioritize your time, energy, and resources, engage in appropriate self-care steps, and take actions to resolve the perceived stressors you are facing, you can resolve Stage 2 and move back into a state of balance. By effectively handling stress, you become stronger and more stress-resistant and stress-resilient. However, if you fail to take adequate self-care and do not resolve stressful situations effectively—and this happens for a significant period of time—you may crossover into Stage 3 of the stress response: Exhaustion.

However, it’s vitally important to discover your optimal levels and types of stimulation, see them as positive challenges, and balance them with rest and recovery. This balance will vary from person to person. Some people are more geared to handle dramatic situations and spontaneous changes, while others need a little more ease and structure to feel right with life.

Researchers at the University of Chicago have found that “stress hardy” individuals have a proactive attitude toward stress.[xx] These individuals “view stressors as challenges and chances for new opportunities and personal growth instead of as threats. They feel in control of their life circumstances, and they perceive that they have the resources to make choices and influence events around them.”

In other words, those who’ve become stress hardy adopt an empowered mindset and make choices to have more balance in their lives. Dr. Herbert Benson found that in addition to having a positive outlook, stress-hardy individuals have good social support systems, engage in purposeful activities, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet.[xxii] They also have reliable ways to de-stress, which brings us back to our main subject—meditation.

Transforming Your Health, Energy, and Emotions Many people come to meditation to learn how to de-stress, consciously relax, and unwind. Meditation is a highly effective tool to help you activate your body’s natural relaxation response. It’s a proven method to cultivate inner peace. It’s also a powerful way to become more aware and accepting of yourself, others, and life in general. Yet, what if it could act on an even deeper level to transform the very structure of your body, heart, and mind?

For example, what if you could switch on your genetic potential to neutralize cancer cells and stimulate your immunity in relation to any disease or virus?

Your Body as a Multi-Layered, Intelligent Information System Think of your body as an infinitely complex, masterfully balanced, multi-layered, information system. Four primary types of information are transmitted through this system: nerve signals, biochemical signals, biomechanical signals, and subtle energy signals. Nerve signals are conducted through your brain, spine, and nervous system, while chemical signals are transmitted through your endocrine, digestive, lymphatic, and circulatory systems. Biomechanical pressures are transmitted through your muscles, bones, connective tissue, and respiratory system, and subtle energies flow through your connective tissue, meridians, and subtle energy centers.

Normally, all this happens beneath your conscious awareness. You just experience the surface feelings that sum up what’s happening subconsciously. However, did you know you have a powerful impact on all this signaling activity by the thoughts and feelings you focus on, the food and drink you consume, and the behaviors you engage in? Have you considered the profound implications of your conscious participation or your lack of conscious participation in these processes?

in the human bioinformation system of the body, heart, and mind, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and behaviors alter the entire cellular environment determining if our cells are in “growth mode” or “protection mode.” As a result, you feel relaxed, positive, empowered, and expansive or stressed, fearful, anxious, negative, limited, and contracted.

For example, the simple thought, “I’m no good at this” signals your body to slump forward. Slumping leaves you less space to take a full breath, so your breathing becomes shallow and restricted, and you take in less oxygen. Your abdominal space becomes cramped, which inhibits your digestion and absorption of nutrients. Your spinal muscles become lax, so lose your “backbone,” your willpower, and your ability to stand up for who you are and what you desire. As a result of all of this, your mood, energy, and mental clarity dip, and you start thinking of ways to “survive” rather than to “thrive.”

Further research into the phenomenon of how your mind affects your body has shown that thoughts and feelings quickly signal all the way down to the DNA level. This signaling immediately affects which of your genetic potentials are “up-regulated” or activated and which ones are “down-regulated” or turned off. When you consider that, at any given point in time, you are expressing only 1.5 percent of the genetic potentials stored in your DNA library, there is a tremendous opportunity for you to select different genetic expressions in a conscious way. You can consciously participate in switching on genes for optimal function and switching off genes for mental-emotional distress and physical disease.

See if it’s possible to let go of “trying” to do anything and appreciate having a few moments of “just being.” For a few moments, be grateful for what is, without striving to achieve anything. The bottom line is to allow the feeling of smiling to come easily and effortlessly, by putting a subtle smile on your lips and allowing the feeling of calm happiness to spread throughout your body.

Every cell in your body replaces itself every 7 to 10 years—and some renew much faster than this. Our stomach cells recycle every five days, and our skeletal cells recycle every three months. The raw material of the DNA changes every six weeks. If you want to change the way your body, heart, and mind renews itself, you need to change your habitual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, so you consistently send new signals to your cells. Changing the ways you interpret and respond to events in life is especially important when you feel stressed. When events happen that feel threatening, you naturally want to stop the flow of life. You want to shut things down. You freeze or retreat. You seek refuge from the storm of emotions and try to stop them from flowing.

You may try to define things in ways that make them less scary, such as, “Life is safe if I just stick to what I know, who I know, and the places I know, instead of venturing out of my comfort zone.” You may try to define yourself in ways that keep you safe, such as, “I am just not good at that, so I won’t try.” You define comfort zones of thinking, acting, and relating—and defend them against change. You try to keep things just the way they are.

Then, you naturally attach to these tightly defined boundaries of self, relationships, and events as if your life depends upon them. This creates tension in your body and mind. These tensions harden—and you harden to life. You lose your receptivity to change and diversity and your capacities for growth, healing, and renewal. You lose your capacity to “go with the flow.”

Steps to Release Inner Tensions 1. Pause when you notice any of the above, any sign of tension, distress, irritation, or discomfort. For a moment, see if it’s possible to let go of fear. For a moment, see if you can let go of catastrophizing what’s happening and making it bigger. For a moment, let go of any stories your mind wants to tell about where these symptoms will lead. 2. Mindfully pay attention to the sensations inside your body. Notice the felt qualities. Is the discomfort located anywhere specific in your body? Does this area have a shape, size, color, texture, sound, and intensity? See if you can do this with curiosity and without judgment. 3. Allow a sense of space to surround the area. Gently allow a compassionate spacious awareness to surround the tense area embracing, infusing, and soothing it. Allow this space to expand in all directions, so the space feels large, and the area of tension feels small. Imagine this space radiates calm happiness and compassion.

4. From your point of view within the spacious area, ask the tense area if it has anything to tell you. See if you can just float this question, listen, and feel without rushing to have an answer. Notice anything that arises, whether it’s a thought, feeling, image, or sensation. 5. Breathe through the tense area. As you inhale, imagine and feel as if you are breathing love and compassion into the tense area. As you exhale, imagine and feel you are releasing the tension out of your body. Continue breathing in this way until you have insight, feel relaxation, and/or notice a shift in what is happening. If you get distracted, bring your attention back to the area you’re focused on and notice how it feels.

Cues for Relaxation, Posture, and Positive Energy in Subtle Energy Meditation 1. Set up a comfortable seat in a quiet private space. A good seat height sets your hips level with or slightly above your knees. If you are able, sit upright on the front edge of your seat with the soles of your feet flat on the ground and parallel with each other. 2. Rest your hands, palms cupped, in your lap, right hand resting in the left, with the tips of your thumbs touching lightly in a gesture of composure and receptivity. 3. Look straight ahead, soften your focus, and open your peripheral vision. Gently close your eyes and keep them still. 4. Focus down into the soles of your feet and feel the sensations of your feet contacting the ground. Allow your feet to soften and relax, imagining that your feet are melting down into the ground. 5. Focus in on your palms and fingers and feel the sensation of contact with your legs. Allow your palms and fingers to soften and relax, imagining as if they are melting down into your legs. As your hands relax, allow your arms and shoulders to relax down, releasing any tension in your shoulders and neck. 6. Imagine a string attached to the top of your head, drawing your spine gently upright, giving you a feeling of vertical spaciousness up through the core of your body, up through your spine, and through the top of your head. Imagine your spine is like a string of pearls or a stack of gold coins—aligned, tall, and dignified. Tuck your chin in slightly, gently lengthening the back of your neck. Allow your shoulder blades to separate slightly and your elbows to separate slightly away from your body, as if you have wings. 7. Roll the tip of your tongue up to touch the roof of your mouth and lightly close your lips, so you are breathing in and out through your nose only. 8. Smile, a subtle smile of calm happiness. Allow the feeling of smiling to relax your jaw and your eyes. Release any tension in your eyebrows and forehead. Allow the feeling of smiling to wash down through your whole body, creating a positive inner environment. Imagine every cell is smiling, opening, communicating with every other cell, and radiating pure positive energy. Go ahead and try these now. Read through this relaxation, posture, and positive focus sequence and follow along with your eyes open. Then, close your eyes and notice how you feel.

In our view, meditation is a complete system of personal development and spiritual transformation. Yes, it will help you de-stress, relax, and feel better—and it is so much more than this. It will help you calm your emotions, clear and quiet your mind, and connect with inner guidance. It will develop your ability to concentrate, visualize, and focus on strong intention. It will help you to be more conscious, integrated, and connected to elevated Awareness and the finer frequencies of Peace, Love, and Light. A powerful supporting factor in these results is posture training.

You’ll also strengthen your “backbone,” your ability to “stand strong,” and follow through on your intentions. These common expressions are not mere metaphors.

In summary, maintaining an upright spine strengthens the spinal muscles, while supporting alert attention and the will needed for focused attention. Relaxing while maintaining an upright spine releases chronic tension and brings the spine into alignment. This relaxation enables the smooth and full transmission of nerve signals along the spine, through the three brains, and out to all your internal organs.

Why is this important? It’s important because mindfulness is what enables you to know where your attention is, and to be kind and gentle with yourself when you notice your attention has wandered off to some automatic thought, feeling, or behavior.

As you focus on being mindful during meditation, you’ll notice moments when your mind drifts off to something other than your focal object. This drifting is going to happen. When it does, practice the 3Rs: Recognize what grabbed your attention, Release this, and Return to your chosen focus. To do this requires energy and effort. You will have to bring your attention back to your chosen focus many, many times. This is normal. Attention wanders and gets pulled away. Our minds work by association and can be triggered by a multitude of internal and external stimuli. This happens automatically, without your control. If you don’t consciously take control of your attention at these moments, it’s going to be pulled into automatic grooves. This is going to happen, and when it does, practice the 3Rs—again, and again, and again.

Relaxation sets the stage for Concentration. Concentration begins with focusing on one point or focal area, expands to focus on paths between points, and culminates with more diffused “whole-field” awareness. Fields can include the field of your body as a whole, the space around you, wider spaces and regions, the field of the whole planet, the Infinite Field of the Whole Universe, and the boundless field of Pure Consciousness itself.

As we said, point, path, and field awareness each have a purpose. One-pointed concentration enables you to selectively attend to one thing and let go of the rest. Concentration on paths between points enables you to experience connection. And, concentration on Fields dissolves boundaries and tensions, so you rest in a state of Unity Consciousness or Nondual Awareness. This ultimate state of absorption is a diffused awareness that takes you beyond concentration into effortless immersion in the Field of Being. This state is generally identified with transcendence or liberation. In this state, you are released from struggles of self-focus and experience the blissful light of Pure Consciousness.

Enlightenment through Subtle Energy Meditation Attention is energy. When you focus and concentrate attention on any area, it builds an electrical charge. As this charge builds, it becomes a magnetic attractor of felt sensation that draws your attention into absorption. The stronger the electromagnetic field, the stronger the felt sensation, and the deeper the absorption.

As we explored these three dantians and researched EEG studies, certain patterns have emerged. Concentration to the point of Absorption in the lower, middle, and upper dantian enables us to connect with and embody the Peace, Love, and Light that is accessed through each of them, respectively.

The lower dantian is home to the vital energy derived from digestion as well as to the feeling of deep inner Peace of being grounded in the present moment. Concentration here supports relaxing alpha rhythms in the brain and even deeper theta rhythms with long-term practice. The middle dantian is home to feelings of love and compassion that come from experiencing the deep connectedness of all beings. With practice, concentration here supports delta rhythms in which we let go of being an isolated individual self and empathically merge with the One Life We All Share. The upper dantian is home to high-frequency light and the guidance available from the Source of our Collective Consciousness. With practice, concentration here supports gamma frequencies of elevated energy and Awareness. When you put this all together, you get the Light, Love, and

“Nondual Awareness is a discrete shift in awareness, in which the consensual, apparently manifest reality of normal waking, adult sensory experience, is perceived to derive from a singular unmanifest source in a seamless whole.”

In Nondual Awareness, the division of “I” and “other” is transcended. In our practice of Subtle Energy Meditation, we’ve identified four subtle variations of this shift. These may arise as distinct variations or may fuse together seamlessly: 1. Choiceless Attention, which is like an empty state in which nothing arises. 2. Infinite Spacious Awareness of the Whole Field of Consciousness. 3. Hearing the sound of OM (or AUM), the primary signal of Creation, the primordial vibration that brings forth and sustains all Life.  4. Clear Light, as the Infinite Space of Awareness brightens with bliss.

Choiceless Attention is a complete letting go into “no-thing,” so that no discrete experience congeals. This experience dissolves any attachments to self, and its thoughts, feelings, actions, and desires. Resting in Choiceless Attention, no experience forms. There is an empty space of Pure Consciousness that arises in stillness and silence.

Expanding the sense of spaciousness in all directions, there’s a subtle shift into Infinite Spacious Awareness, an experience of the Whole Field of Consciousness, a boundaryless, limitless expanse. This gives an experience of Oneness beyond all forms; All is connected in a seamless whole that is aware or that is Awareness itself.

Sometimes, in this expanse, the Infinite Space brightens, a “Lightness of Being” spontaneously arises, a Clear Light permeates the Whole Space and brings indescribable bliss. A soft effervescent energy infuses the Field of Awareness with an eternally abiding peace and joy. At other times, the OM vibration permeates this Infinite Space. Tuning in to the primordial Sound has synchronizing and healing effects. All is brought into alignment with Source Consciousness. These primordial elements of Sound and Light attune you to the harmonious creative activity of Being itself. All events in life flow effortlessly from this attunement.

“If you notice any movement of thought, feeling, body, or attention, let go into stillness. Imagine and feel this still point sinking deep down into the Earth, where it anchors a rock-solid, immutable, peace. Focus deep down into this still point. Let go. . . . Be still. . . . Let go. . . .

It is the hum of the Infinite Space of Awareness itself. At first, it may feel like nothing at all.

The Progression of Subtle Energy Meditation In meditation, there is a progression from outer sensory perception, to coarse inner sensations, to subtle sensations, to objectless imagery, to Nondual Awareness. You first need to learn how to sustain attention on coarse meditation objects, like physical sensations of relaxation, posture, and breathing. This is a first inner layer of interoceptive awareness.

As you sustain mindfulness, the breath becomes the subtle breath: pure energy, light, love, and deep peace. This is a second, more subtle layer of interoceptive awareness—energetic awareness. Absorption in subtle energy frequencies leads to objectless imagery: silence, stillness, and spaciousness.

Immersion in silence, stillness, and spaciousness is formless awareness, a bridge beyond form and content. Sustaining this awareness requires the lightest touch of attention. It must be held and carried lightly, for trying to hold onto it chases it away. You must remain still, silent, and spacious. Waiting, listening, letting go, staying open, and paying attention—as transcendence beyond the “self” opens.

Resting in formless awareness, a subtle shift occurs: the one observing knows itself as that which is observed. Awareness aware of itself. There is only Awareness—Nondual Awareness, Pure Consciousness without division, form, or content, also known as Clear Light Awareness. The Clear Light, formless emptiness, is also One, rich, vibrant, and full—a transcendent space from which all forms emerge. There is a luminous bliss in this awareness. Emerging from this state and returning into a sense of individuality, there is a sense of connection with all other individualities as a result of our formless Oneness. This sense of connection is maintained as we keep the transcendent state as a background reference, the horizon within which we have experiences.   The process of Subtle Energy Meditation is like peeling an onion, beginning with using interoception to shift inward, under the layer of outer sensory awareness to inner sensations of relaxation, posture, and breathing. These lead to the next inward layer of subtle energy sensations, which lead to formless awareness of stillness, silence, and spaciousness. Patiently peeling away the last layer so that no form remains is entering the realm of Nondual Awareness, Pure Awareness beyond content and form.

4. Formless Awareness of stillness, silence, and spaciousness 5. Nondual Awareness beyond content and forms Each layer of awareness unfolds naturally, as the previous layer is realized. So, don’t move too quickly. Allow each layer to unfold fully, naturally, as you sustain mindful attention. Take your time. In time, you can experience transcendence in every moment, experiencing Nondual Awareness as immanent within each moment of Life. Life itself is aware. Life itself is Awareness—Pure Consciousness expressing, arising, and dissolving, in an infinite variety of momentary forms. Living in this realization transforms your experience of life. Transcendence is freedom—freedom from doubt, stress, fear, struggle, and confusion; freedom from identification with thoughts, feelings, sensations, habits, memories, conflicts, traumas, labels, achievements, and all the ways you identify your “self”; freedom from any and every “thing”—so you rest in a state of Pure Awareness beyond form. Within this Nondual Awareness you engage with life in a whole new way.

Step 5, Returning and Grounding, is this bridge from a period of meditation back into life, so there is a continuum of awareness. Meditation is not so much a separate experience apart from life, but a time of connection to the Transcendent Awareness that underlies and permeates life. We then bridge from this experience of transcendence to awareness of this world by grounding our meditative consciousness in our bodies.

This is a crucial step before you rush off into the activities of your day. Without this step, your meditation becomes a forgotten memory and your life will tend to return to running on automatic programs and reacting to outer demands unconsciously. Your meditation may have been a nice experience, but it will have little impact in your life and the lives around you. It will be like a brief holiday, an experience that is lost as you jump back into the fray of worldly pressures and obligations. So, Returning and Grounding is about merging your inner meditative experience with your outer experience in the world, so they integrate as a unified whole; so, there is no separation. Awareness infuses the body. There is a recognition of the fact that Awareness infuses Life—and you experience this through the sensations in your body.

After you’ve discovered transcendent awareness of Awareness itself and rested here for a while, your task is to return consciously and intentionally. Take your time with this step, as it’s the key to meditation transforming your everyday state of consciousness—the baseline state you live from. It’s the key to shifting how you view yourself, others, and Life in a more permanent way.

Your body is the bridge for this return. Your body is both a bridge to transcendence Beyond and a bridge back into this world. A first step on your return is to feel your body as a whole from the inside, to sense the entire space inside your skin. Spacious awareness is a bridge to transcendence and now it’s a bridge back into the body as you return to sensing the space inside your body.

Through the course of this meditation, you experience different frequency bands of the Universal Life Force, each with their particular purposes. Light focuses, illuminates, informs, energizes, elevates, and inspires. It helps to release lower-level energies and perspectives and provides inner guidance. Love brings a warm, soothing experience of harmony, unity, and connection that comforts and nurtures. Experiencing Love flowing through your heart facilitates compassionate relationships with yourself and others. Letting go into the deep Peace of stillness grounds the energy, while calming your system and releasing any effort, movement, or tensions of self. In stillness, you dissolve into formlessness and open to Pure Conscious awareness of Awareness itself—Nondual Awareness.

The bio-survival program first attaches to the safe space around the mother (oral imprint), and then with age moves further and further out, exploring what is safe and what is not. Without hard-wired genetic programs (i.e., automatic programs) this second stage would be impossible, and no mammal would ever leave the teat. The hard-wired programs act automatically (UNCONSCIOUSLY) because if you had to stop and think out each situation, you would be eaten by the first predator.

STAGE ONE: Put all your effort into forming and holding a conscious intention to sit down and meditate for a set period every day, and to practice diligently for the duration of the sit. When your intentions are clear and strong, the appropriate actions naturally follow, and you’ll find yourself regularly sitting down to meditate. If this doesn’t happen, instead of chastising yourself and trying to force yourself to practice, work on strengthening your motivation and intentions. STAGE TWO: Willpower can’t prevent the mind from forgetting the breath. Nor can you force yourself to become aware that the mind is wandering. Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the “aha” moment that recognizes mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath. Then, intend to engage with the breath as fully as possible without losing peripheral awareness. In time, the simple actions flowing from these three intentions will become mental habits. Periods of mind-wandering will become shorter, periods of attention to the breath will grow longer, and you’ll have achieved your goal.

STAGE THREE: Set your intention to invoke introspective attention frequently, before you’ve forgotten the breath or fallen asleep, and make corrections as soon as you notice distractions or dullness. Also, intend to sustain peripheral awareness while engaging with the breath as fully as possible. These three intentions and the actions they produce are simply elaborations of those from Stage Two. Once they become habits, you’ll rarely forget the breath.

STAGES FOUR THROUGH SIX: Set and hold the intention to be vigilant so that introspective awareness becomes continuous, and notice and immediately correct for dullness and distraction. These intentions will mature into the highly developed skills of stable attention and mindfulness. You overcome every type of dullness and distraction, achieving both exclusive, single-pointed attention and metacognitive introspective awareness.

STAGES EIGHT THROUGH TEN: Your intention is simply to keep practicing, using skills that are now completely effortless. In Stage Eight, effortlessly sustained exclusive attention produces mental and physical pliancy, pleasure, and joy. In Stage Nine, simply abiding in the state of meditative joy causes profound tranquility and equanimity to arise. In Stage Ten, just by continuing to practice regularly, the profound joy and happiness, tranquility, and equanimity you experience in meditation persists between meditation sessions, infusing your daily life as well.
